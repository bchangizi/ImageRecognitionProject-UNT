# Multiple Object Recognition Project

##Using CMake
Cmake uses the current working directory to output the make files or IDE files so you'll probably want to 'mkdir' an output directory.
To create build ready files simply invoke 'cmake <path-to-CMakeLists.txt> ', path can be relative.
Once it does it's magic, you're ready to build by invoking 'Make' or Visual Studio sln.
You can also tell it to invoke the compiler for you by invoking 'cmake --build <path-to-makefiles/idefiles>'
Any errors will print on the console otherwise you'll have your binary in the same folder or on windows 'Debug' or 'Release' depending which you set(default is 'Debug')
